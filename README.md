# E-Commerce-Web-Scraper-API (Educational Use Only)

This project is an example of a web scraper built using Node.js and Express. It's designed to interact with e-commerce websites and retrieve product information, such as reviews and offers.

Please note: This project is intended for educational purposes only. It's designed to showcase programming skills, such as the ability to work with APIs, handle HTTP requests, and manipulate data. It is not intended to be used to scrape real data from Amazon or any other e-commerce site.

It's crucial to respect the terms of service of any website or API you interact with. Unauthorised web scraping can violate the terms of service of the website you're scraping and could have legal consequences. This example project should not be used to scrape data from any website without explicit permission.

This project should be used as a learning tool to understand how web scraping works. When applying the concepts learned from this project, always ensure you have permission to scrape and use the data you're accessing, and always use APIs and other data sources responsibly.

Please use responsibly and ethically.
